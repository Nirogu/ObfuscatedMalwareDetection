## Obtaining the sample

### Goodware

The goodware samples used for this project were obtained using 2 different sources.

The first one was using the service [PortableApps](https://portableapps.com/) provides, we manually download all the software this solution offer, moved all the files from all the folders to a single location.
On parellel, for the second option, we installed a 32 bit version of Windows 10 and copied all files from the `System32` folder, moved all the files from all the folders to that same location and then the preprocess stage begun.

For the preprocess stage, for each file we used the `file` command from an Ubuntu installation to remove all files that didn't include the strings `PE32 executable`and `for MS Windows`. This process can be seen on `dataset_creation_scripts/cleanType.py`. This lef us with a total of 15628 goodware samples.

#### Malware

To obtain the malware samples we contacted the staff team of [VirusShare](https://virusshare.com/) and requested acess to their malware repository. Once the access was granted, we donwnloaded the torrent which contained PE for microsoft Windows and repeated the process of cleaning by type using `dataset_creation_scripts/cleanType.py` and then randomy sampled the same amount of binaries as we had on goodware to avoid having a disbalanced dataset, this can be seen on `dataset_creation_scripts/cleanAmount.py`
